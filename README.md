# Babirusa_Toman
Adding Iranian Toman to magento 2
- Magento 2 uses PHP ICUData for currency values so adding a new currency to Magento 2 is not that easy.
- This module is using custom resource files to add a new currecny to Magento 2.
- I've added Iranian Toman to Magento 2 by this module but any custom currency (such as bitcoin, etc) can be added using the same method.
- You can also install this module in your own project using composer, but use it at you own risk.
note: Use composer to install this module, because without proper autoload configuration this module won't work.
